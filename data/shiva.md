In fact, there is no form to **Shiva**. **Shiva** is a principle (Tattva) from where everything has come, everything is sustained in it, and everything dissolves into it. **Shiva** is the space, it is the consciousness. There is no way that you can even step out of **Shiva** at anytime because **Shiva** is the *summum bonum* of the whole creation.
