**Brahma** is the source, the seed and the creator of all beings in this world. He is also the revealers of sacred knowledge including the Vedas. At the time of creation, he emerged as the first differentiated consciousness (the first ego) from the primal waters (universal consciousness). He is called *svayambhu* because in reality none created him. As Isvara, he created himself. **Source**: [Hinduwebsite.com](https://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/brahma.asp).
